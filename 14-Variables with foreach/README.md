# Variables with **`For_each`** Loops

In Terraform, variables can be combined with `for_each` loops to create dynamic configurations based on a set of values. This allows you to iterate over a list of values and use each value within the variable definition.

## Using `each.key` and `each.value`

When using `for_each` with a variable, you can access the current iteration's key and value using `each.key` and `each.value`, respectively.
- `each.key`: Represents the current key from the loop's iteration.
- `each.value`: Represents the current value associated with the key.

## Example 1: Creating Multiple S3 Buckets
Here's an example that creates multiple S3 buckets based on a variable containing bucket names:

```sh

variable "bucket_names" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["bucket1", "bucket2", "bucket3"]
}

variable "bucket_region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  for_each = var.bucket_names

  bucket = each.value
  region  = var.bucket_region
}

```
---

### Explanation
- `bucket_names`: A list of bucket names.
- `bucket_region`: The region for all buckets.
- `for_each = var.bucket_names`: Iterates over the list of bucket names.
- `bucket = each.value`: Sets the bucket name for each iteration.
- `region = var.bucket_region`: Sets the region for all buckets.

This example demonstrates how to create multiple resources based on a list of values, using for_each to iterate over the list and access the values using each.value.

## Example 2: Using `each.key` in a Terraform Resource
e want to create multiple EC2 instances with unique names based on a list of instance types.

```sh

variable "instance_types" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["t2.micro", "t3.nano"]
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  for_each = var.instance_types

  instance_type = each.value
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Replace with your desired AMI

  tags = {
    Name = "instance-${each.key}"
  }
}

```
---

### Explanation
- `instance_types` variable: Defines a list of instance types.
- `for_each` loop: Iterates over the `instance_types` list.
- `each.value`: Sets the `instance_type` for each instance based on the current value in the list.
- `each.key`: Creates a unique name for each instance using the `index (key)` of the current element in the list

This configuration will create two EC2 instances with the following names:
- instance-0 (using the t2.micro instance type)
- instance-1 (using the t3.nano instance type)
